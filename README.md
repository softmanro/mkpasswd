Based on the original Debian whois package (version 5.3.2) from
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/w/whois/

This bundle contains a modified version of mkpasswd (100% compatible with the
original Debian version) that provides automatic salt generation based on
random bytes generated by OpenSSL which has been seeded from /dev/random.
